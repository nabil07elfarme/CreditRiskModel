This Jupyter notebook contains code and visualizations for credit risk modelling. The notebook first loads a dataset of German credit applications and performs some basic data cleaning and exploration. Next, the notebook builds and evaluates classification machine learning models for predicting credit risk. Finally, the notebook discusses the results of the analysis and provides some recommendations for future work.

The notebook is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
The notebook is well-organized and commented, making it easy to follow and understand. The code is also well-formatted and easy to read.

The visualizations in the notebook are clear and informative. They help to illustrate the results of the analysis and make the findings more accessible.
